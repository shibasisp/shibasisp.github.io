   Finally, I made my mind to write a blog. After struggling so much to write something, I realized that even if you have too much to say and express, itâ€™s just your words that the world counts.

   Writing this blog not only improve my writing but also make a log of activities done by me. Here, I will share whatever I learn, whatever problems I encountered and How I solved them. This blog will be more inclined towards Linux, Python/Ruby lovers and open source enthusiast.
