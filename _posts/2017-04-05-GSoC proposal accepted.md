Hello World!

I haven’t had a nerve wracking wait for something in a long time.  The results have been out and I am glad and excited to say that my project **Casacore Testing** has been selected under GSoC-2017.

I would like to thank my mentors, **Gijs Molenaar** and **Tammo Jan Dijkema ** for helping me get started, being (really really) patient throughout my doubts and giving feedback on by proposal.

Coming to the project, [Casacore](https://github.com/casacore/casacore) is a sub-organization under [OpenAstronomy](http://www.openastronomy.org/) .  [python-casacore](https://github.com/casacore/python-casacore) is a set of Python bindings for [casacore](https://github.com/casacore/casacore), which is a suite of c++ libraries for radio astronomy data processing. This project aims to improve python-casacore infrastructure, making the codebase cleaner, modern, maintainable and adding more unit tests.

I plan to start work early as possible so that I can get sufficient time to complete Part 1 of the project. Looking forward to working with casacore !!!
